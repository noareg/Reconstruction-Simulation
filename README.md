# 🏗️ Reconstruction Simulation

This C++ project simulates reconstruction plans for settlements in SPLand. Developed as part of a systems programming assignment for my computer science degree at Ben-Gurion University.

## 🚀 Features
- Object-oriented design using C++ principles
- Multiple reconstruction strategies:
  - Naive
  - Balanced
  - Economy-focused
  - Sustainability-focused
- Simulates building facilities with different impacts on life quality, economy, and sustainability
- Full action log tracking and backup/restore options

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/noareg/Reconstruction-Simulation.git
2. Build the project: make
3. Run the simulation: ./bin/simulation <config_file_path>
